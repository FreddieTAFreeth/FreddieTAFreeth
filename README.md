I’m @FreddieTAFreeth, former Fesearch Fellow in Mathematical Modelling and Epidemiology in the School of Veterinary Medicine at the University of Surrey, and I am now a PhD student in the same department. I’m interested in mathematically modelling complex systems, mostly from biology. I have worked on projects ranging from neuroscience, to ecology, to parasitic epidemics. Feel free to contact me here, or via my LinkedIn.
